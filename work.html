      <h4>JPL Flight Software Simulation</h4>
      <p>In order to safely drive the Mars rovers, a team of engineers at JPL created a suite of simulation tools so that rover planners can write and execute sequences for the rover while visualizing the environment on Mars. My project during my internship was to create a web frontend for the Mars 2020 flight software (in React). The application takes in a file of rover commands (available in different formats such as the Rover Markup Language and Rover Sequencing Language), a start time, the previous day's terrain, and several other parameters. The application then sends a call to the API for the flight software, which simulates the expected behavior of the rover and returns it in the Rover Kinematic State Markup Language (RKSML). This RKSML file is passed into a 3D visualization tool, written in three.js, which is displayed as an interactive video on the frontend. Alongside the 3D visualization is a live command editor with command validation, a table for viewing thousands of event records, and a chart that displays the sequence durations of each command and sequence from the original input file. It has numerous components for the user to interact with and meets the needs of different target audiences including each of the instrument teams and eventually, the rover planners as well.</p>
      <p>When I first arrived at JPL over the summer, all I knew about this project was that I needed to piece together an existing Event Record Viewer (EVR) and a 3D visualization tool (created internally at JPL) to visualize rover commands. The project seemed vague and did not have much of a direction, and my mentors were unable to offer much help, since they were inexperienced in frontend development. Drawing from my user-centered design classes in college, I felt like what was most important for the development of this application was to understand the user's needs and present the application in a way that would be intuitive for the user. In a development-driven environment and during such a short internship, going through the design process felt like a challenge. However, through a couple of user interviews and eventually meeting with members of the rover instrument teams, I was able to piece together the application in a way that made the most sense to the user. I was also able to conduct a few rounds of user testing and consequently realized several usability issues that were immediately fixed. The design process helped me create an application that, while functionally similar to what would have been created by another developer, improved the user's experience and considered the needs of the different target audiences.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, I also faced several technical challenges during the development of the project. The first issue I faced was the integration of the existing EVR. It had been created years prior and was computationally expensive when the EVR needed to only display and filter through a table of records. The previous EVR was disregarded and instead, I learned to develop with the thousands of existing node packages such as react-data-table, react-redux, and react-ace. Several challenges throughout the summer also presented themselves when I was given internal tools to integrate into this frontend application. The existing 3D visualizer was created as a standalone app and through weeks of debugging the three.js code, the original developer and I were able to package the visualizer to run in my application. In addition, I wanted to make use of the existing command validation tools in the command text editor but faced several issues when it came to interfacing the older command validation with the newer flight software. Solving these integration issues exposed me to many of the different challenges that JPL engineers were involved in and enforced the need for collaboration between teams. Finally, working on this project gave me the experience in creating and packaging an app for deployment in a work environment. I learned to test my code with Jest, package it with webpack, and deploy it after creating a Docker image.</p>

      <h4>Currents</h4>
      <p>In this project, we find a solution to the question: How can we optimize energy usage in single occupancy rooms depending on the thermodynamics of each room and the user's location? i.e. how likely is it that the room will be in use at specific times of day? This project is a collaboration between engineers, who provide the research behind the energy optimization problem, and computer scientists, to write the algorithm that controls the HVAC settings and to deliver a mobile app as the user interface.</p>
      <p id="currents_cs">The CS team is split into three components:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The mobile app, which allows users to check & edit the state of their HVAC systems and their energy usage;</li>
        <li>The prediction algorithm, which predicts when the HVAC systems should be on or off based on the user's calendar events, location data, user-inputted events, and past prediction patterns; and</li>
        <li>The server, which runs many backend processes such as the algorithm, writing to the databases, user authentication, etc.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As the lead of the CS team, my responsibilities include training team members on their respective parts of the project, managing the progress of the team, and interfacing our technologies will with the thermal engineering team and the building's HVAC systems. As a result, I've learned and taught the various skills required by the team, including servers and APIs, databases, algorithms, and mobile development. This project has also expanded my knowledge in managing a larger project that is both dependent on creativity and innovation, as well as user-centered design.</p>
      <p>When I first joined the team, there had been a lot of prior research on the problem we were trying to solve, but soon after, the upperclassmen on the team graduated and left poorly documented code, along with only a few notes explaining their work. When I was chosen to be the next team lead for the Computer Science subteam, I felt lost and did not understand much of the work that had been left to me. I spent my first semester as lead working through the core issues with my team and restructuring the CS team. We thought about the scale of our project and how we would eventually scale up, beyond single occupancy rooms; we mapped out each part of the project and listed the types of data we needed, then recreated our databases accordingly; and we rewrote the existing code for the prediction algorithm so that it could predict the current day's heating schedule and rerun each time the user modified their own schedule through the mobile app. The structural changes I envisioned gave our team a better understanding of our code base and allowed us to properly document the code for the future. I've served as the team lead for a year and a half now, and most recently, we set up our API endpoint to handle the GET and POST requests needed by the mobile app; we deployed our mobile app (written in React Native); we have a working algorithm that predicts the user's schedule for the day; and we've begun researching how to improve our prediction algorithm based on the user's patterns. Although I'm graduating soon, I've been a part of the project's development for a while and have watched it evolve as we learn more about thermal modeling, interfacing with different types of HVAC systems, and ways we could potentially market our app. Being on this project has taught me a lot about systems engineering, imagination, and collaboration in unique ways when dedicating myself to an ambitious, long-term project.</p>

      <h4>OnShape: Remote 3D Object Interaction</h4>
      <p>OnShape was an idea inspired by several of the projects from the MIT Tangible Media Group such as Recompose and inForm. Our goal was to create an intuitive interface that allows the user to make gestures to manipulate their physical environment. More specifically, the user controls the display through hand gestures under an XBox Kinect sensor. The image of the Kinect is read in real-time and translated into x-y and depth values, which are then sent to the Arduino and translated into a form that indicates which motors should run, which direction they should rotate in, and the number of steps they should run for. The motors allow the user to observe the linear motion of the objects on the actuated surface.

      <h4>Database Management System</h4>
      <p>For the final project for my Functional Programming and Data Structures course, my group wanted to create something practical and settled on creating our own database management system, based on MySQL. Several challenges we faced in the implementation of our own DBMS were considering how to store the data and the table schemas efficiently; how to read in our data so that we wouldn't have to maximize space and time efficiency; how to modularize our code to separate each of the functions; and finally, how we wanted the user to interact with our system. We decided to store the data in text files, where each database has its own schema file in an input folder and its own folder with each of the tables and their data. This allowed us to keep our entire system under a certain size instead of needing to store each table as an OCaml data structure. In the text files, rows are separated by new lines, which made reading and writing to the data easier. On the computational end of the DBMS, each line in the file channel is read, then filtered through a bunch of functions depending on the optional parameters in the queries such as WHERE, ORDER BY, and JOIN. The resulting table is either printed to the Command Line or to a text file depending on the size of the table.</p>
      <p>Based on the constraints of the project, the final queries we were able to implement include: SELECT, INSERT INTO, DELETE FROM, CREATE TABLE, and DROP TABLE, with additional parameters including WHERE and all of its conditionals (such as LIKE, =, !=), ORDER BY, INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and RIGHT JOIN. As the only member in my group who had prior experience in working with databases, I ended up implementing most of the queries for our DBMS.</p>

      <h4>Shortest Path Optimization</h4>
      <p>The setting: a spaceship traveling from Earth to Planet X in the shortest path possible, then returning to Earth while collecting the most gems on the way and staying within the allotted fuel. From first glance, it wasn't difficult to complete the project at all; I already knew how to write Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm. Next, came the million-dollar question: how would I optimize the shortest path algorithm, i.e. how would I collect the most gems and still make it back to Earth? After multiple ideas and different sets of code, the final version I settled on was to visit the neighboring planet with the most gems, making this a greedy algorithm, while calculating at each planet if I would have enough fuel to make it back to Earth.</p>

      <p>Scavenger is an app designed for the Ithaca Farmer's Market to solve the unique need of improving patron-vendor relations and encouraging patrons to explore new vendors at the market. It gamifies the farmers market experience and rewards users with levels and badges as they complete tasks, such as scanning the QR code of a new vendor at the market, referring a vendor to a friend, or sharing their experience at the market on social media. The app also provides the contact information of each vendor and allows the user to search through the vendor directory and favorite certain vendors. Scavenger was an app created after going through the design process, from user interviews to affinity diagramming, creating personas and scenarios, sketches and wireframes, user testing, and several design iterations.</p>

This task started straight from the drawing board: a completely blank piece of paper, an empty frame in Sketch, and an empty file of code. However, through brainstorming, scribbling rough sketches, creating wireframes, user testing and revisiting the drawing board, writing pseudocode, and finally implementing the pseudocode, we were able to create a final product with many well-thought out features. My role on the team was primarily in the backend development of the website, in features such as file storage and retrieval. I also did a few rounds of user testing and some frontend development as well in the earlier stages of the development. We faced several problems throughout the implementation of the database, such as deciding on how to sort the members and having conflicts merging our code without overriding each other, but were ultimately able to complete a beta version in only a few months. </p>

      <p><span class="bold">My role:</span> Android Developer<br />tran.z.ent is an app addressing the difficulty doctors have in diagnosing their patients regarding sleep disorder, created at the Health Hackathon at Cornell. The app is composed of two main components: first, an algorithm that compares patient breathing patterns with those of patients with common sleep disorders such as asthma and sleep apnea; and second, an Android application that allows patients to track their sleep and subsequently alerts health care providers of possible sleep disorders. My team had a difficult start in the process because we realized that essentially all phone apps that track sleep are laregly inaccurate, and there was no definite way to estimate a person's sleep based solely on micriphone recordings or slight movements. The beginning of the night began with all hands on deck on conducting research in sleep patterns and detection. After we determined that the best solution was to track the patient's heart rate, I began the design and implementation of the app using Java in Android Studio and was able to complete a rough prototype.</p>

      <h4>my kitchen</h4>
      <p>As a college student, I wanted a way to organize the items I had in my pantry, to create grocery lists, and to cook simple recipes with the ingredients I had without having to spend so much time worrying about my meals and my weekly shopping trips. So I decided to create an app just so I could do that. I've been able to work through the entire design process, from sketching, to prototyping, and finally, developing. I've also taken on both roles of frontend and backend developer through the design of my app and the creation of a backend API. I'm excited to soon have a completed app that will make my life easier and may benefit the lives of many other busy college students.</p> >
