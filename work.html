      <h4>Shortest Path Optimization</h4>
      <p>The setting: a spaceship traveling from Earth to Planet X in the shortest path possible, then returning to Earth while collecting the most gems on the way and staying within the allotted fuel. From first glance, it wasn't difficult to complete the project at all; I already knew how to write Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm. Next, came the million-dollar question: how would I optimize the shortest path algorithm, i.e. how would I collect the most gems and still make it back to Earth? After multiple ideas and different sets of code, the final version I settled on was to visit the neighboring planet with the most gems, making this a greedy algorithm, while calculating at each planet if I would have enough fuel to make it back to Earth.<br><span class="bold">Languages used:</span> Java</p>

      <h4>Tetris</h4>
      <p>Tetris is my favorite game and I had a blast coding my own version as well. Not only did I get to work with the graphics in Python but I also had to determine each stage of coding the game, focusing on details such as creating each individual block, timing the falling of the blocks, updating the scores & speed, and a lot more. It was an elaborate project but was so rewarding to complete and to be able to play! <br/><span class="bold">Languages used:</span> Python</br><span class="bold">Code:</span> <a href="https://github.com/vml39/tetris">https://github.com/vml39/tetris</a></p>

      <h4>Hearsay A Cappella Website Design</h4>
      <p><span class="bold">My role:</span> Project Manager, Web Developer<br/>My team of three chose to create the site for Hearsay A Cappella as our final project for web design & programming. In the division of work, I took on the pages that required developing the backend framework and programming using JavaScript and PHP. I also managed team meetings and delegated tasks over the course of the project. As a team, we designed the website from scratch and conducted multiple rounds of user testing starting from personas to people from our target audience. Every week at our team meetings, we would talk through the design and functionality of each page, and edit accordingly, until we were able to finalize a version we were all satisfied with. <br/><span class="bold">Languages used:</span> HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP</br><span class="bold">Code:</span> <a href="https://github.com/vml39/INFO1300_finalproject">https://github.com/vml39/INFO1300_finalproject</a></p>

      <p><span class="bold">My role:</span> Project Manager, Web Developer, Data Scientist<br/>In a team of four, we took on the complete design and implementation of the website for Shimtah, a performing group on campus. Their website was a bit more complex and required us to use PHP sessions to securely implement a member login as well as SQlite to keep inventory of the club's instruments. I took on the implementation of the backend portion including all code in PHP and DB queries. I also managed team meetings and delegated tasks according to each member's strengths.

      <h4>CUSD Alumni and Active Member Database</h4>
      <p><span class="bold">My role:</span> Backend Developer<br/>On the Technical Operations team of Cornell University Sustainable Design (CUSD), we took on the creation of an alumni and active member database in only one semester. This task started straight from the drawing board: a completely blank piece of paper, an empty frame in Sketch, and an empty file of code. However, through brainstorming, scribbling rough sketches, creating wireframes, user testing and revisiting the drawing board, writing pseudocode, and finally implementing the pseudocode, we were able to create a final product with many well-thought out features. My role on the team was primarily in the backend development of the website, in features such as file storage and retrieval. I also did a few rounds of user testing and some frontend development as well in the earlier stages of the development. We faced several problems throughout the implementation of the database, such as deciding on how to sort the members and having conflicts merging our code without overriding each other, but were ultimately able to complete a beta version in only a few months. <br/><span class="bold">Languages used:</span> HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js</p>

      <p><span class="bold">My role:</span> iOS Developer<br/>re(source) is an app created by me and my friends in response to the prompt, "develop an application or tool that assists its users in the event of a crisis", at Technica, an all women's hackathon at UMD. We chose this prompt because we wanted to make a large social impact, and despite the dozens of crisis-related apps out there, there were none of this function. The purpose of the app is to connect community members in times crisis by allowing members to ask one another for spare resources or track user-reported supply inventories at local markets. It was my first time participating in a hackathon and it was a really exciting experience to be able to develop a project from just a prompt to a final product.<br><span class="bold">Languages used:</span> Swift</p>

      <p><span class="bold">My role:</span> Android Developer<br/>tran.z.ent is an app addressing the difficulty doctors have in diagnosing their patients regarding sleep disorder, created at the Health Hackathon at Cornell. The app is composed of two main components: first, an algorithm that compares patient breathing patterns with those of patients with common sleep disorders such as asthma and sleep apnea; and second, an Android application that allows patients to track their sleep and subsequently alerts health care providers of possible sleep disorders. My team had a difficult start in the process because we realized that essentially all phone apps that track sleep are laregly inaccurate, and there was no definite way to estimate a person's sleep based solely on micriphone recordings or slight movements. The beginning of the night began with all hands on deck on conducting research in sleep patterns and detection. After we determined that the best solution was to track the patient's heart rate, I began the design and implementation of the app using Java in Android Studio and was able to complete a rough prototype.<br><span class="bold">Languages used:</span> Java</p>

      <h4>my kitchen</h4>
      <p>As a college student, I wanted a way to organize the items I had in my pantry, to create grocery lists, and to cook simple recipes with the ingredients I had without having to spend so much time worrying about my meals and my weekly shopping trips. So I decided to create an app just so I could do that. I've been able to work through the entire design process, from sketching, to prototyping, and finally, developing. I've also taken on both roles of frontend and backend developer through the design of my app and the creation of a backend API. I'm excited to soon have a completed app that will make my life easier and may benefit the lives of many other busy college students.<br><span class="bold">Languages used:</span> Swift, Python</p>
