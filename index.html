    <h1>About</h1>
    <div id="about_info">
      <p>Hi, I'm Vivian! I'm a sophomore studying Computer & Information Sciences at Cornell University in Ithaca, NY. I'm also a developer who is interested in software engineering and full-stack engineering. I have experience in a multitude of programming languanges, such as Java and Python, and fields, such as software development, web development, and product design.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>I'm looking for a software development internship in a challenging and collaborative team environment. I'm really hoping to test all of the skills I've learned in my classes and extra curricular activities from my time in college, and expand upon them wherever I find myself working.</p>

                  <h1>Spaceship Rescue: Shortest Path Optimization</h1>
                  <img alt="" src="images/a8.gif">
                  <p>This was by far one of my favorite coding projects, done in Java. The setting: a spaceship trying to get to Planet X from Earth in the shortest path possible, then trying to return to Earth while collecting the most gems on the way and staying within the allotted fuel. From first glance, it wasn't difficult to complete the project at all; I already knew how to write Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm. Next, came the million-dollar question: how would I optimize the shortest path algorithm, i.e. how would I collect the most gems and still make it back to Earth? After multiple ideas and different sets of code, the final version I settled on was to visit the neighboring planet with the most gems, making this a greedy algorithm, while calculating at each planet if I would have enough fuel to make it back to Earth. </p>

                  <p>This project really challenged the (lack of) artistry in me: I implemented a paint program using the Java graphical user interface (GUI) API. I coded pencil, eraser, eyedropper, airbrush, line, circle, zoom, and color tools into the interface and took into consideration many of the specifics of each tool (e.g. the number and randomization of dots in the airbrush tool). When the program was completed, I was even able to create this wonderful masterpiece!</p>

                  <p>Tetris is my favorite game and I had a blast coding my own version as well. Not only did I have to work with the graphics in Python but I also had to determine each stage of coding the game, from creating each individual block, to timing the falling of the blocks, to updating the scores & speed, and a lot more. It was an elaborate project but was so rewarding to complete and to be able to play! (P.S. I'm level 103 on Tetris Battle.)</p>

                  <img alt="" src="images/applefest.png">
                  <p>My first large project in web design was to redesign the <a href="http://www.downtownithaca.com/ithaca-events/35th%20Apple%20Harvest%20Festival%20Presented%20by%20Tompkins">website</a> for the annual Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival. I started the redesign with a blank piece of paper and a pencil, sketching and user testing my sketches until I was satisfied with both the functionality and design of the site. From there, I used HTML and CSS to create and style the content of the site, JavaScript to write and validate a feedback form, and PHP to connect the framework of the site and do serverside validation of the form.

                  <p>In my Web Design & Programming Course, our final project was to create a website for a client in the Ithaca community; my team of three chose to create the site for Hearsay A Cappella. On the team, I served as the project manager by managing team meetings and delegating tasks over the course of the project. I also taught my team how to use GitHub so that we could collaborate efficiently on the project. Regarding the content of the site, I took on the pages that required developing the backend framework and programming using JavaScript and PHP. The specific pages that are completely mine are: index.php, current_members.php, alumni.php, contact.php, faq.php. With the team, together, we designed the website from scratch and conducted multiple rounds of user testing. Every week at our team meetings, we would also talk through the design and functionality of each page, and edit accordingly, until we were able to finalize a version we were all satisfied with.

                  <p>On the Technical Operations team of Cornell University Sustainable Design (CUSD), we took on the creation of an alumni and active member database in only one semester. This task started straight from the drawing board: a completely blank piece of paper, an empty frame in Sketch, and an empty file of code. However, through brainstorming, scribbling rough sketches, creating wireframes, user testing and revisiting the drawing board, writing pseudocode, and finally implementing the pseudocode, we were able to create a final product with many well-thought out features. My role on the team was primarily in the backend development of the website, in features such as file storage and retrieval. I also did a few rounds of user testing and some frontend development as well.
                    We faced several problems throughout the implementation of the database, such as deciding on how to sort the members and having conflicts merging our code without overriding each other, but were ultimately able to complete a beta version in only a few months. </p>
