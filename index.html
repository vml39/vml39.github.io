    <h1>About</h1>
    <div id="about_info">
      <p>Hi, I'm Vivian! I'm a sophomore studying Computer & Information Sciences at Cornell University in Ithaca, NY. I'm also a developer who is interested in software engineering and full-stack engineering. I have experience in a multitude of programming languanges, such as Java and Python, and fields, such as software development, web development, and product design.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>I'm looking for a software development internship in a challenging and collaborative team environment. I'm really hoping to test all of the skills I've learned in my classes and extra curricular activities from my time in college, and expand upon them wherever I find myself working.</p>
      <p>Check out some <button class="blue" id="facts">fun facts</button> about me!</p>
